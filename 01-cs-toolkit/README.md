# 01 — CS Toolkit

**Micro-Project** | Month 1 | Semester 1

## Objective

Build a repository of 8–12 solved programming problems demonstrating computational thinking, structured problem-solving, and algorithmic reasoning.

## Deliverables

- [ ] 8–12 solved problems with structured notes
- [ ] Each solution includes: problem statement, approach narrative, time/space complexity analysis, edge cases
- [ ] All code written in VS Code and pushed via Git

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.10+
- VS Code
- Git/GitHub
